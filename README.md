## This repo is a small project on Sign Language Detection using LSTM (Tensorflow) for 3 classes(1. Hello  2.Thank you  3.I love you).

### ◉ Object Detection and Classification Problem.

### ◉ main.py is the main python file which runs the pretrained model.
### ◉ train_your_model.py is the file which helps you to train the model with your own input data
